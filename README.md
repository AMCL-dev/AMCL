## Introduction  
AMCL is a modern, open-source Minecraft launcher built with Python and PySide6. It puts every feature right where you expect—no digging through nested menus. Instantly find Mod Management, Game Customizing, ModLoader installs (Forge, NeoForge, Fabric, Quilt, LiteLoader, OptiFine), one-click Mod-pack creation, UI themes, and more from the first screen.

AMCL runs everywhere: Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and already-tested on x86-64, ARM, fully-featured, and intuitively laid-out—launch Minecraft the easy way.
